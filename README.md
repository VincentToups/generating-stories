Generating Stories
==================

The subreddit "Am I the A**Hole?" is a popular spot, and
understandably so. If you are asking a bunch of anonymous people on
the internet to excuse your behavior, you know you've done something
which is, at the very least, socially provacative. And whether the
reader gives their blessing to the poster or not, they are given the
opportunity to either vicariously experience the righteous indignation
of the poster driven to such extreme actions, or the direct righteous
indignation of judgement. Either way, its a coherent package of
experience.

The sub-reddit also represents a nice data set for fine tuning a
language model for story generation. Every story which makes the front
page is likely to be dramatic and in similar ways. And since the
community makes a final judgement of whether or not the story really
represents bad behavior, the data set comes along with a nice set of
labels.

In this repository I'm experimenting with generating AITA-like stories
using GPT-NEO models fine tuned on AITA datasets.
